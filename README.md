tutum-docker-glassfish
=====================

**This image will be deprecated soon. Please use the docker official image:** https://hub.docker.com/_/glassfish/

[![Deploy to Tutum](https://s.tutum.co/deploy-to-tutum.svg)](https://dashboard.tutum.co/stack/deploy/)

Base docker image to run a Glassfish 4.0 application server


Usage
-----

To create the image `tutum/glassfish`, execute the following command on the tutum-docker-glassfish folder:

	docker build -t tutum/glassfish .

To run the image and bind to port :

	docker run -d -p 4848:4848 -p 8080:8080 -p 8181:8181 tutum/glassfish

PS: 4848 (for administration), 8080 (for the HTTP listener), and 8181 (for the HTTPS listener)

The first time that you run your container, a new user `admin` with all privileges
will be created in Glassfish with a random password. To get the password, check the logs
of the container by running:

	docker logs <CONTAINER_ID>

You will see an output like the following:

	========================================================================
	You can now connect to this Glassfish server using:

	    admin:b1uKcRK3r6SF

	Please remember to change the above password as soon as possible!
	========================================================================

In this case, `b1uKcRK3r6SF` is the password allocated to the `admin` user.

You can now login to you admin console to configure your Glassfish server:

	http://127.0.0.1:4848/


Setting a specific password for the admin account
-------------------------------------------------

If you want to use a preset password instead of a random generated one, you can
set the environment variable `GLASSFISH_PASS` to your specific password when running the container:

	docker run -d -p 4848:4848 -p 8080:8080 -e GLASSFISH_PASS="mypass" tutum/glassfish

You can now test your deployment:

	http://127.0.0.1:8080/

Done!
